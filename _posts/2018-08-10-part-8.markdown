Hello, it's Part 8, which is the last part!  Hooray!  We wanted to end by listing some other worthwhile resources, for both writing excellent software and for doing excellent MIR.


## Software Engineering Resources

[Software Carpentry][software-carpentry] teaches a huge range of basic software skills, from command lines to version control to R to Python to SQL.

[So You Want To Be A Wizard][wizard] is a fantastic distillation of how to work with computers and how to get better at them, by the amazing [Julia Evans][jvns].

[Learn Python The Hard Way][the-hard-way] teaches Python starting from 0, and goes up to a fairly advanced level.  The books cost money, but have free samples!


## MIR Resources & Tools

[musicinformationretrieval.com][mir] is a great resource for just about everything about MIR.

Some other packages and datasets you might want to look at include [crema], [pescador], [crepe], [pysox], [msaf], [motif], [lakhmidi], the [Million Song Dataset, the [Million Playlist Dataset]
  

## Success!

We did ... just about everything!
