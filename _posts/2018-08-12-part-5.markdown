Hello & welcome to Part 5!  This is the section about testing, why testing is important, how to do it, and how to set up your repository to run your tests automatically when you push new code.

## Why Shall We Test Our Code?

Tests make your life easier and give you confidence in your code.  Software is complicated, and tests allow you to be sure that you've not broken your project when you change something.  

Writing tests slows you down in the short term, but speeds things up in the long term.  Further, as someone who is writing scientific code, tests make sure that your work can be easily reproduced.

## Fix a Test

Let's start by working through fixing a failing test, and commiting the results to our repository.

Start by making a new branch, with `git checkout -b fix-failing-test`.

Then open up `<some-filename>`, uncomment the function called `<test_some_function>`, and then run `pytest`.

The test failed, oh no!

So, that test is testing a function that we've stubbed out, but that returns obviously incorrect results.

You can find the function in `<filename>` - go ahead and fix the function so that the tests pass.  Run `pytest` as much as you want to, to make sure.

Great!  You should also write a new test to verify that this function works correctly for `<some edge case>`.

Philosophically, each test should test one thing.  This makes it easier to ensure that we can see what has broken when a test breaks.

Once `pytest` shows that both tests are passing, commit your changes, merge on github, and then pull the results back to your local.

#### Checkpoint

Run:
{% highlight bash %}
pytest
{% endhighlight %}

You should see:
{% highlight bash %}
platform darwin -- Python 3.6.5, pytest-3.7.2, py-1.5.4, pluggy-0.7.1
rootdir: /Users/thorkell/Code/bmcfee/shablona, inifile:
collected 5 items

tests/test_shablona.py .....          	                        [100%]
{% endhighlight %}


## Get Travis Working

We set up our Travis account in Part 2!  Travis is a service that runs your tests when you push new branches to GitHub.  This is useful because it means that you can't forget to run your tests â€“ and it means that other people's PRs will have tests run against them.

Travis is controlled by a file called `.travis.yml`.  This file tells the Travis servers what to do with your code - in our case, just run the tests.

We've written the file for you.  Let's take a quick look at it.  The big `install` block handles the gruntwork of installing conda, updating it, and setting up our environment.  The `script` block is what Travis runs.  We currently just run `pytest`.

Let's modify this to run [Flake8][flake8] as well.  Flake8 checks your code and your code style, to make sure that you're writing code that is both more correct, and easy to read.

All you need to do is add `flake8` below the call to `pytest`, then commit and push your code.

Then, open up Travis, and you can see your tests run!

Cool, so our tests are passing!  But what will it look like when our tests fail on Travis?  Let's find out!

Open up `some file`, and add `import sys` to it.  This is a valid statement, but Flake8 won't allow unused imports.  Commit this to a new branch, and push it to GitHub.

Travis will start running your tests ... and Flake8 will complain!  If this were someone contributing code to your repository, you could reply to them and say something like "Great work, please fix the flake8 issues and then we can merge it!"

We just wanted to see what happens when tests failed, so feel free to delete that branch, and then move on.

#### Checkpoint

You've seen your tests run on Travis, and had a test branch fail on GitHub!  You should also have flake8 working locally.  cd to the `shablona` directory, and then:

Run:
{% highlight bash %}
flake8
{% endhighlight %}

You should see no output, indicating that things work!

**Gotchas:**
- Rarely, your tests will pass locally but fail on Travis.  This is super frustrating, and is usually caused by there being a difference between your local environment and the Travis environment.


## Success!

We've added two tests, and gotten comfortable running pytest.  Furthermore, we've enabled Travis, so that our tests always run when we push code to GitHub.  In [Part 6][tutorial-part-6], we'll set up our documentation so that it builds automatically, and write some new docs.
