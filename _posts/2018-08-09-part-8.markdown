Hello, it's Part 8, which is the last part!  Hooray!  We wanted to end by listing some other worthwhile resources, for both writing excellent software and for doing excellent MIR.


## Software Engineering Resources

[Software Carpentry][software-carpentry] teaches a huge range of basic software skills, from command lines to version control to R to Python to SQL.

[So You Want To Be A Wizard][wizard] is a fantastic distillation of how to work with computers and how to get better at them, by the amazing [Julia Evans][jvns].

[Learn Python The Hard Way][the-hard-way] teaches Python starting from 0, and goes up to a fairly advanced level.  The books cost money, but have free samples!

[This project][mini-kep] has a good overview of Python testing practices, and this thread has [even more testing resources][twitter-testing].

## MIR Resources & Tools

[musicinformationretrieval.com][mir] is a great resource for just about everything about MIR.

Some other packages you might want to look at include [crema], [pescador], [crepe], [pysox], [msaf], and [motif].

Useful datasets and APIs include [lakhmidi], the [Million Song Dataset][msd], the [Million Playlist Dataset][mpd], the [Spotify API][spotify-api], and the [Audio Content Analysis List][aca-list].

Finally, if you want to learn more about DSP and audio processing, you could take a look at [Julius Smith's books][jos], as well as the teaching parts of [Audio Content Analysis][aca-teach].


## Success!

We did ... just about everything!

We went over installing things in [Part 1][part-1], and setting up web servives in [Part 2][part-2].  [Part 3][part-3] covered git and version control, and [Part 4][part-4] went over Python and Python module structure.  Testing was covered in [Part 5][part-5], and documention in [Part 6][part-6].  Finally, [Part 7][part-8] introduced the wider Python ecosystem, and this is Part 8.

Thanks for coming along for the ride, and please feel free to ask us questions over the rest of the conference!
